# Assignment 1 â€“ Unit & Integration Testing

A small React + Vite application built for learning **unit tests** and **integration tests** with **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.  

The project demonstrates:  
- Unit testing (`CounterButton`, `DeleteButton`)  
- Integration testing (`TodoList` with `TodoItem` + `DeleteButton`)  
- Mocking external calls (`RemoteTodos` with mocked `fetch`)  
- Code coverage measurement with Istanbul
